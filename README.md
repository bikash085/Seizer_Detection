# Seizer_Detection
Here We converting the EEG(Electroencephalography) signal to unique amino acid sequence to determine the preictal and ictal phase.
Here we need to first converting the data into amino acid sequence by using Watson-Crick rules in the preprocessing part 
Then apply differnt models to classification of preictal and ictal phase
